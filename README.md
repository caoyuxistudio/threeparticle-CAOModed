# threeparticle-CAOModed

A modified fork of NewKrok's Three.js particle system and its visual editor,
extended for Cao Yuxi's (曹雨西) media-art installation work.

## Layout

```
packages/
  three-particles/   the particle library (fork of NewKrok/three-particles)
  editor/            the visual editor  (fork of NewKrok/three-particles-editor)
```

The editor depends on the library through `file:../three-particles`, so the two
always travel together — this is the reason they live in one repository.

## What this fork adds

Every item below is understood only by **this** library. A config saved here and
loaded by the stock `@newkrok/three-particles` does not error — the unknown keys
are merged in and never read, so the piece silently renders wrong.

| Feature | Config |
| --- | --- |
| Curl-noise flow field (spatially coherent motion) | `noise.curl` |
| Per-axis damping of the noise displacement | `noise.influence.{x,y,z}` |
| Start colour sampled from an image over the emitter's X/Z plane | `particleColorInstance` |
| Image brightness drives curl strength (signed, so dark or bright can be the moving half) | `particleColorInstance.useLuminanceForNoise`, `luminanceNoiseAmount` |
| Per-axis mesh scale | `renderer.mesh.scale` |
| Mesh oriented along its direction of travel | `renderer.mesh.alignToVelocity` |

All of the above run on the **WebGPU compute backend**. On the CPU backend they
are ignored or fall back to the stock behaviour.

## Running the editor

```bash
cd packages/three-particles && npm install && npm run build
cd ../editor && npm install && npm run dev
```

The editor serves on <http://localhost:8080>. `npm run dev` rebuilds on change
but does not reload the page — refresh manually.

## A config is not a self-contained artwork

Reproducing a piece needs four things, only one of which lives in the JSON:

1. this fork of the library,
2. a WebGPU context (`enableWebGPU` from `@newkrok/three-particles/webgpu`),
3. the texture images — the config stores only a texture *name*; the pixels sit
   in the editor's `localStorage`,
4. `renderer.mesh.geometry` — a THREE object the editor builds from the
   editor-only `geometryType` field.
