 * Parallax: the screen as a window.
 *
 * TheParallaxView (algomystic, 2018) tracks the viewer's eye with the iPhone's
 * TrueDepth camera and renders with an off-axis projection, so the screen
 * behaves like a pane of glass: the plane of the screen stays put and what
 * lies behind it shifts with the eye. There is no eye to track here. The
 * phone's own tilt stands in for it: tilting moves a virtual eye across the
 * camera's plane, the output camera moves with it, and its frustum is shifted
 * back so the frame's plane keeps its place in the picture. Only what is
 * deeper or shallower than that plane moves, which is the depth cue.
 *
 * Sources, in order: the gyroscope (deviceorientation; iOS opens it behind a
 * tap-gated prompt) while it is delivering, else the mouse over the window —
 * the desktop stand-in, and what the harness drives.
